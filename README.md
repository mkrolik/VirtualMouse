# Virtual Mouse
## A simple simulator for trying out maze solving virtual bots

- Uses the great collection of Micro Mouse maze files.
- Includes a HumanMouse, to allow you to use your keyboard's arrow keys to manually solve.
- Includes a RandomMouse, to use a random probability distribution to choose a path. (Hope you have lots of time)
- Includes a SlamDfsMouse, builds a map as it is doing online DFS.
